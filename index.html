        <h1>365 South 3rd Street, Brooklyn, NY</h1>

        <p> While I was living in Brooklyn, I Googled "Mel Brooks'
            Childhood" in the hopes I could visit where he lived. 
            I was thrilled to find <a href="https://nymag.com/news/features/childhood/mel-brooks-2013-4/" target="_blank"> this article </a> in which Mel mentions the exact address where he experienced 
            his first adventures.
        </p>
        <p>
           The Sunday that followed my joyous Google search, I visited the address given 
           in Mel's New York Magazine story. I was disappointed to discover that a home with the address Mel cited no longer exists. Instead, the house on the adjacent 
           street filled the space where 365 South 3rd Street must have once stood. 
        </p>
        <p>
           Regardless, it was a meaningful pilgrimage to me and it was a memorable FaceTime call with my Dad 
           who introduced me to Mel Brooks' when I was a teenager. The weekend of my excursion, my Dad was working 
           at a trade show. When my Dad told the people working with him where I was calling from and everyone
           shared our excitement. The mere mention of "Mel Brooks" and the group's energy changed from static to 
           uproarious, receiting favorite lines and laughing in decibels usually reserved for the closest of comrades.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that's what I love most about Mel Brooks. Whenever I think about him, I feel happy.
            Whenever I meet someone who loves Mel Brooks too, I know that we can be friends.
